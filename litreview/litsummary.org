* Phosphene Studies
This table is for my own notes only. Assume all information is directly quoted
from the original paper.

Some papers referenced other papers which sounded useful, but I have not been
able to find yet. [fn:3]

Rarely, one electrode produced two phosphenes (excluded from analysis). Possibly "spanning a sulcus". Phosphenes in one subject increased in separation on simultaneous vs separate stimulation. Simuultaneous stimulation sometimes decreased the size of phosphenes.                                                                                                                  |

Phosphenes lose characteristics when multiple elicited at the same time. | Persistent phosphenes up to 25 minutes after stimulation ceased was reported on rare occasion. At higher current, sometimes a single electrode produced two phosphenes (just above, fuzzier). Phosphenes moved with eye movements, but maintained relative positions. Phosphenes different distance but appear coplanar when simultaneous. Persisting phosphenes sometimes expand.                                                                               |

* Footnotes

[fn:6] This sounds like the same patient to me (same mechanism of blindness,
timeline matches), but I can't explicitly confirm that.

[fn:5] This mentions earlier studies on this second patient "FB", but for the
life of me, I cannot find them. They sound extremely useful too.

[fn:4]  They don't specify the actuall upper limit tested; this was the
"maximum" minimum threshold required to produce a phosphene...

[fn:3] Includes:
1) Pollen DA. Some perceptual effects of electrical stimulation of the visual cortex in man. In: Tower DB, editor. The nervous system, Vol. 2: the clinical neurosciences. New York: Raven Press, 1975: 519-28., k
2) Evans 1979 Brightness of phosphenes elicited by electrical stimulation of
   human visual cortex. in Sensory Processes
3) Shakhnovich, AR and Ogleznev, K Ya and Abakumova, L Ya and Tishchenko, LS and
   Razumovskii, AE 1982, Phosphene formation during electrical stimulation of the
   visual cortex in Human Physiology, Springer
4) Foerster 1929 (not in English)
5) Krause 1931 (also not in English)

[fn:2] Article actually said "Bipolar" - is that the same as biphasic?  maybe
not? ALso, I can't actually read find the allison article pdf for reading from
Monash librar...Found the abstract and a record, but not the actual paper.

[fn:1] This was the lowest /threshold/, but couldn't find the actual lowest
current tested.
