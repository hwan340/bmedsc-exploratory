*** Summary

    Discusses necessary modules for implementation of simulated prosthetic
    vision (SPV) and how these modules have previously been implemented.
    Includes discussion of phosphene typefaces, maps, processors and renderers.
    The discuss on phosphene processing is quite cursory (mostly limited to
    straight image processing algorithms), but the review as a whole provides
    useful links to previous studies of simulated prosthetic vision to look at
    further.

  Also described as "round and *carrying colour*".

  They provide links to multiple reviews on cortical phosphenes which might be
  worth reading.

  They mention reports of "elongated phosphenes", "doughnuts" and "dot
  clusters".

*** Phosphenes (from Optic Nerve)
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (1 . 0.7651451660516605)
:END:

Optic nerve based stimulation produces differnt types of phosphenes - "clusters
arranged in oval or rectangular areas of the visual field sometimes superimposed
on a coloured background"

*** Phosphene Table
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (2 . 0.10038468142681425)
:END:

There's a great table of phosphene appearances based on site of stimulation.

Something I'm a little confused by :


| Multiplicity | "Reflection about the horizontal and vertical meridians" |

Does this mean phosphenes are reflected? I hope not...

*** Simulating prosthetic vision non-generalisable?
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (2 . 0.5148650545454545)
:END:

Authors recognise this limitation.

To resolve, simulations try to build components "from first principles" of
"descriptions  provided by first-hand observers."

*** Phosphene utility for prosthetic vision
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (2 . 0.5594719444794953)
:END:

"It has been shown...that it is possible to form recognizable symbols and
rudimentary shapes from mutliple simultaneously elicited phosphenes"(!)

There are some references I might have a look at here.

Notably - "no device has been demonstrated to render a complete visual scene
with simultaneosly presented phosphenes "

*** Phosphene definition
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (2 . 0.7857935636363635)
:END:

Here's an actual definition for phosphenes - "any visual sensation caused by
means other than stimulation of the visual system by light." (including
mechanical forces, magnetic stimulation, and electric stimulation)

"Single elementary spot of light in the visual field."

*** Phosphenes required for close to normal visual acuity and navigation
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (2 . 0.8066342181818181)
:END:

Reference included here, might be useful to take a look at .

This is an old paper though, and "many other investigators have since published
their own SPV investigations."

*** Simulated prosthetic vision components and process
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (3 . 0.18141458181818182)
:END:

There's a discussion of what's needed in a SPV:

1. Phosphene typeface - set of phosphene styles that could be retrived by
   indexing on Phosphene Modulation Indices (PMIs) such as size index and luminance
2. Phosphene map - location of phosphenes on the visual field
3. Phosphene processor - image processing component, that takes a visual scene
   and calculates the PMIs for each location on the map that could then be
   rendered to a typeface
4. Phosphene renderer - displays / composes the processed phosphene field.


#+begin_notes

As an aside:

Funnily enough, I can sort of see a parallel of the SPV with Elm and Elm-webgl.

On init, you create the *phosphene map* as a set of vertices. Your
*phosphene typeface* is part of the vertex or fragment shader. You can then, on
every animation frame (which should coincide with the framerate of the camera)
process the image and create a list of uniforms which correspond to *phosphene
modulation indices* - e.g. luminance and size index (which are easy enough to
modify the vertex shader with).

If Elm can communicate with the camera on say an iPhone or the webcam, then this
could be an easy way to demonstrate these on the browser. The only difficult
thing is how to process the image in the browser efficiently...

(It seems like this should be done with getusermedia, which elm doesn't have
supported at the moment so would need to be done through a port/ports).

#+end_notes

In terms of correlating this with what's seen clinically:

- Phosphene typefaces could be created based on observations and data from the
  implant recipient
- PMIs "correlate to appropriate electrical stimulus parameters for eliciting
  the desired phosphene appearance"

The design is modularised so each can be mixed and matched. I suppose I would be
working on the phosphene processor aspect.

*** "Common form" of phosphenes
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (3 . 0.37805680110497236)
:END:

"The common form of phosphenes is a small round *colored*[?] sport of light in
the visual field."

| Fovea/parafovea  | Sharper edges |
| Peripheral field | Cloudy edges  |

Unsure what they mean by colored - what color? Same color throughout space/time?

In the next paragraph - phosphene descriptions are "dominated by the common form"

They mention that it's actually unlikely for these pto be circular - round can
mean many things.

*** Phosphene visual appearance table
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (4 . 0.06895853482260184)
:END:

Really comprehensive table on how different simulated prosthetic vision devices
have been implemented by paper with lots of references.


- Shapes :: mostly circle, square, Gaussian. Not sure what they mean by Gaussian
  shape? They might just mean circles which have a Gaussian gradient on them, so
  instead of having a fixed brightness throughout the circle, theyhave a bit of
  a "less bright as you go further out" kind of thing
- Size :: not sure how to comment except they're quite fine (I think) - the
     resolution may not actually be that bad.
- Lattice :: not entirely sure the didfference between bitmap and square (are
     they implying the square lattice has a gap between pixels), but I think it
     makes sense to have a square/bitmap representation for ease purposes.
- Resolution :: eccentric seems like a good thing to represent how it might
     "realistically" look.
- Field of view :: small, but I'm not sure what our own field of view is, so I
     can't compare at this stage.
- No of grays :: Not sure what this might mean except perhaps the luminosity as
     a PMI.
- Image processing :: This is probably the most interesting part for me. I can
     see some ones I'd expect and some that are familiar to me (mean, edges,
     depth, DoG, LoG, Gaussian,) but some really interesting ones (*Neural
     network* - Eckmiller et al 2004/2005, Becker et al 1999, HanziConverter -
     Chai et al 2007.  )


*** Image flowcharts of SPV modules
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (5 . 0.06030325641025641)
:END:

Good flowchart of how SPV modules connect.

*** Phosphenes don't have sharp boundaries
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (5 . 0.867365205128205)
:END:

‘phosphenes elicited electrically in the retina do not resemble
sharp-edged round dots”

Here they also specifically state that they use a Gaussian luminous distribution
over teach pixel to "feather" the edges I suppose - makes sense!

*** Phosphene colours
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (6 . 0.6120930232558139)
:END:

Some further discussion about phosphene olours- seems like this might not be
controllable. May be dependent on luminance (seems the colour changed as
stimulation current increased with the luminance).

"Colourless (white) or lightly coloured phosphenes dominate the isual
descriptions from chronc implantees."

Because colours are hard tocontrol, using a grascale model is pretty much the
standard. - but this is not actually realistic, as patients report seeing some
colour (and this would need to be incorporated into the simulation).

*** Stimulus strength increases luminance and maybe size of phosphenes
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (6 . 0.7162790697674418)
:END:

So multiple luminence levels could be achieved

*** Epiretinal stimulation difficulty reproduce
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (6 . 0.9246511627906976)
:END:

Seems to be a problem if you can't reproduce the percept!

*** Phosphene sizes
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (7 . 0.11720930232558138)
:END:

Usually around *0.5-2.0 degrees* (but large variability in size, usually
compared to things at arm's length. )

*** TODO Braille reading exercise to check utility of phosphenes
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (7 . 0.3516279069767442)
:END:

Sounds like an interesting experiment, should followup to read about what what
they did and their results.

*** Phosphene typeface should be different for each electrode
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (7 . 0.9116279069767441)
:END:

Raised a good point - the phosphene typefaces probably should be different for
each electrode in the recipient.

*** Mapping procedure to calibrate phosphene map
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (8 . 0.5599999999999999)
:END:

They talk briefly about the difficulty of this - one of the methods, using
relative distance between phosphenes and triangulation, seems like it actually
would be pretty useful and possible to solve somehow mathematically.

*** Using regular vs irregular phosphene map lattices
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (8 . 0.7423255813953488)
:END:

Mentions specifically that while regular maps may be more amenable to certain
transforms (Fourier transform of spatial frequencies?), "may not be readily
applicable to irregular phosphene maps in implant recipients"

It seems irregularity could be implemented as another parameter.

*** Processing time lag is very critical
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (9 . 0.19534883720930232)
:END:

Need to minimise this as much as possible - incongruence with "vestibular and
visual sensory input...is a prime factor leading to motion sickness symptoms
such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, disorientation etc. as demonstrated by
Howarth and co-workers."

*** Image processing on overlapping phosphenes
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (9 . 0.27348837209302324)
:END:

This sounds like an interesting avenue to pursue - interactions between
neighbouring phosphenes.

*** Techniques for image processing
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (9 . 0.3125581395348837)
:END:


- Impulse sampling :: Directly maps image grey level values to the phosphene map to produce a PMI
- Mean filter :: "average gray value over area centered at location designated
     by phosphene map" - sounds similar to a non-weighted blur (it's just an
     aveage kernel) - "most comonly used process for calculating PMIs in the
     literature"
- Gaussian filter :: weighted towards the center
- Laplacian of Gaussian filter - "luminance contrast between the centre and the
  surround of this receptive field is represented by the phosphene" - a very
  interesting way of describing edge detection!

*** Spatiotemporal vs spatial phosphene processor
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (10 . 0.45581395348837206)
:END:

Sounds like an interesting paradigm shift - might be worth look up these papers.

Here's a quote from their website:

#+begin_quote
However, even with 1000 electrodes, it is uncertain whether or not there would
be a sufficient density of phosphenes to rely upon a bit-map approach to vision.

While only a portion of the primary visual cortex (V1) would have implanted
electrodes, preliminary studies suggest that we can compensate for this lack of
spatial coverage through user scanning, allowing the user to perform at least
elementary visual tasks such as navigation and object recognition.
#+end_quote

That's quite importat.

There's some work from the group of mapping phosphenes which might be useful to
read.

There's also one of the members' dissertation, which has a short section on
image processing:

- https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.lib.monash.edu.au/docview/2023814113?pq-origsite=primo

It sounds like the image processing algorithm is based on pixel intensities.

Here's a nice quote from the article..(I've downloaded the PDF and should make
separate notes but just in case I forget to):

*** Suggestion that "rudimentary prosthetic vision" can be beneficial and benefits often underestimated by sighted individuals
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (8 . 0.6563207458563536)
:END:

#+begin_quote

Importantly, the likely beneﬁts of even limited visual restoration to a blind
individual are often under appreciated by sighted individuals (Lane et al.,
2012). Even rudimentary prosthetic vision in the setting of profound blindness
may have signiﬁcant positive psychological and functional rami- ﬁcations for a
blind individual, contributing to reduced feel- ings of isolation and depression
(Dagnelie, 2008). Only a few reproducible phosphenes may be required to improve
an individual's quality of life. For example, a recipient of the Dobelle implant
was able to navigate independently and read letters on a Snellen chart with only
21 phosphenes at his disposal (Dobelle, 2000).

#+end_quote

Sounds like a really good outcome - but I wonder how consistently this can be
achieved.

#+begin_quote

In the most simple of demonstra- tions, the reported elation felt by blind
volunteers stimulated with only 4 occipital electrodes, in addition to their
ability to independently locate a light source (Button and Putnam, 1962),
suggests that questions of what constitutes “accepta- ble” performance by both
recipients and treating physicians alike, needs to be carefully balanced.

This is quite heartening to hear.

*** Phosphene maps move with eye saccades

Not only does this compli- cate the generation of consistent phosphene maps, but
it also introduces a requirement for central gaze ﬁxation during head turning,
or sophisticated eye tracking technology to ensure image stability during
changes in eye position.

*** Neuroplasticity can make unrecognisable images gradually useful
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (10 . 0.858495232044199)
:END:

#+begin_quote

The work of Dobelle (2000) provided clear evidence that preserved
neuroplasticity in visual cortex can permit a blind individual, who had an
initially poor response to patterned stimulation, to gradually recognize shapes,
letters and features in a relatively complex physical environment. According to
Dobelle (2000), a key factor in achieving this goal was increased computing
power, which permitted the use of more sophisti- cated image processing
algorithms providing enhanced edge detection, whilst keeping frame rates at
acceptable levels.

#+end_quote

I'm actually very interested in the role of neuroplasticity in interpreting
these patterned images. If neuroplasticity and learning is sufficient, then
sophisticated helping image processing algorithms may not ultimately be
necessary (though would perhaps facilitate the training phase by providing
feedback).

In the cortical studies, it was also found that the phosphenes move in space with the

gaze stabilization was simulated by locking the dotted image formed on the retina of the
subject under test. So, if the eye moved then dotted image presented on the screen also

The principal disadvantage of studying volunteers undergoing other

psychophysical experiments under local anaethesia in the operating room,
the limited amount of time available with any given subject, and the fact
that the cortex of interest is frequently affected by pathological processes.

of the dura by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.

Very interesting section on chromatic sensations with phosphenes.

#+begin_quote

These chromatic effects are vivid, and patients generally report coloured
phosphenes as being red, blue or occasionally green. It is interesting to
speculate that on the relationship between these colours and the funda-
mental mechanisms of colour perception. On a number of occasions,
subjects have reported 'unreal' colours. This was first reported by
patient no. 3, whose best description was a 'non-spectral brown' or 'a
colour from another world'. Two other patients in our series (cases nos.
22 and 36) have made similar observations during post-operative de-
briefings.

#+begin_quote

Thresholds increase, and the phosphenes fade during continuous
stimulation of more than 10-15 sec. However, turning the stimulator off
for a few seconds, and then turning it back on, generally caused the
phosphene to reappear at its original brightness.

Phosphenes move with eye movements (so they suggested a microcircuit camera

When a phosphene appears, patients might try to fixate on it, but then it moves,
and they try to fixate again...and they chase it across the visual field. jjj

Important caveat:

However, precise mapping is quite difficult to accomplish in the
operating room. Phosphenes move with eye position, and are frequently
too close together to be resolved due to inaccuracies in pointing.

*** Summary

Seems like a very interesting paper. I see three modes they've described:

- Face mode: using Viola-Jones cascading classifiers for real-time face
  detection from camera image.
- Empty ground mode: use range camera with accelerometer to segment the ground
- Structural edges: use the range camera to highlight edges.

Wondering if perhaps pre-trained models/kernels could be used in a similar
fashion to identify other types of objects.

***** Summary

Attributes:

- 6 x 10 grid of electrodes (60 total)
- Retinal
- Video camera on glasses -> processor on patient's belt "VPU" -> coil on
  glasses side


Dot point summary:

- The Argus II prosthesis is aimed at adults who have become blind (or
  near-blind) due to retinitis pigmentosa.
- Part of the pre-implantation process is ensuring patients understand that what
  they see will not be vision as they know it.

  #+begin_quote
  The vision generated by the Argus II device is very different from sight and
  the patient must be ready to learn a new “language” of sight. Patients with
  the Argus II prosthesis have been able to perform the following tasks after
  implantation and rehabilitation: locate doors, windows and elevators; use a
  crosswalk to cross a street; locate coins; locate utensils on a table; locate
  but not identify people; and track a ball or players on a field

If the dots in each column are

posed to see a pattern of columns (Figure 25–1B). The
principle of good continuation is an important basis

saliency, whereby smooth contours tend to pop out
from complex backgrounds (Figure 25–1D).

*** Simple widely used fidelity measure - PSNR, MSE

#+begin_quote
A simple and widely used fidelity measure is the peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), or the corresponding distortion
metric, the mean-squared error (MSE). The MSE is the
norm of the arithmetic difference between the reference and the
test signals. It is an attractive measure for the (loss of) image
quality due to its simplicity and mathematical convenience.
#+end_quote

This seems like it'd be useful for images with minimal processing, but I'm not
so sure about when the image is degraded to the extent that I'm expect in
simulated prosthetic vision.

Plus, I suppose that image information for simulated prosthetic vision may be
useful even if ultimately transformed in a non-obvious way - such as if the
image is heavily distorted or deconstructed and simply encoded in a way that is
distinct, but contains equal information, to the original image.
